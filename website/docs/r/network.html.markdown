# Resource: nscale_network

Networks provide isolated connectivity boundaries for resources within a region. By default, networks include a route to
the internet with masquerading enabled. Networks require a minimum /24 CIDR range, with the top /25 reserved for storage
integration. Networks support custom DNS nameservers and additional routing configurations.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "nscale_region" "glo1" {
  id = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
}

resource "nscale_network" "example" {
  name            = "example"
  cidr_block      = "192.168.0.0/24"
  dns_nameservers = ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]
  region_id       = data.nscale_region.glo1.id
}
```
