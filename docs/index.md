# Nscale Provider

The Nscale Terraform provider allows you to manage infrastructure on the Nscale platform using standard Terraform workflows. The provider currently supports Nscale networks, security groups, compute instances, and compute clusters, with additional resources planned for future releases.


## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    nscale = {
      source = "nscaledev/nscale"
      # Check the Terraform Registry or GitHub Releases for the latest version.
      # version = "~> 0.0.2"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Nscale Provider
provider "nscale" {
  # Recommended: supply these values via environment variables, not hard-coded here.

  # organization_id = "<your-organization-id>"
  # project_id      = "<your-project-id>"
  # service_token   = "<your-service-token>"
}
```

## Authentication and Configuration

The Nscale Provider first uses values from its configuration. If a value is not set there, it falls back to the corresponding environment variable.

### Provider Configuration

!> **Warning:** Hard-coded credentials are not recommended in any Terraform configuration and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a public version control system.

```terraform
provider "nscale" {
  region_service_api_endpoint  = "<region-service-api-endpoint>"
  compute_service_api_endpoint = "<compute-service-api-endpoint>"
  organization_id              = "<your-organization-id>"
  project_id                   = "<your-project-id>"
  service_token                = "<your-service-token>"
}
```

- `region_service_api_endpoint` (String) The endpoint of the Nscale Region Service API server.
- `compute_service_api_endpoint` (String) The endpoint of the Nscale Compute Service API server.
- `endpoint` (String, Deprecated) The endpoint of the Nscale API server.
- `organization_id` (String) The identifier of the organization for which resources are managed.
- `project_id` (String) The identifier of the project for which resources are managed.
- `service_token` (String, Sensitive) The service token for authenticating with the Nscale API server.

### Environment Variables

```terraform
provider "nscale" {}
```

```shell
% export NSCALE_REGION_SERVICE_API_ENDPOINT="<region-service-api-endpoint>"
% export NSCALE_COMPUTE_SERVICE_API_ENDPOINT="<compute-service-api-endpoint>"
% export NSCALE_ORGANIZATION_ID="<your-organization-id>"
% export NSCALE_PROJECT_ID="<your-project-id>"
% export NSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN="<your-service-token>"
```
